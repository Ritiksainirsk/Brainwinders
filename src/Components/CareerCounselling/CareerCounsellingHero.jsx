        WHAT IS CAREER COUNSELLING?
      </h3>
      <p className="text-black mb-4">
        Career Counselling is a process that helps you understand yourself and
        the world of work to make informed career, educational, and life
        decisions. It involves a structured interaction between the individual
        seeking guidance and an expert career counsellor or advisor. Career
        counsellors provide guidance, support, and resources to help individuals
        navigate these decisions. They help identify interests, abilities,
        values, and personality traits to match them to potential careers. They
        also provide information about the job market, education and training
        programs, and career paths.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-800">
        Career counsellors assist individuals in setting career goals and
        developing concrete action plans to achieve those goals. This involves
        identifying potential obstacles and developing strategies to overcome
        them. Additionally, they may provide resources for further education or
        training, job search techniques, resume writing, and interview
        preparation to enhance employability. Career counsellors offer ongoing
        support and encouragement throughout the career exploration and
        decision-making process, recognizing that career paths may evolve over
        time.
